# BOVI Framework Educational App

**Balanced • Obligated • Value • Immediate** — Understanding the Four Fairness Modes of Money

## What is BOVI?

BOVI explains money as a bundle of four fairness modes, each solving different trade problems:

- **🔵 Balanced** (Equality Matching) — Keeping score, ledgers, fairness across time
- **🔴 Obligated** (Authority Ranking) — Enforced payments, taxes, hierarchy compliance  
- **🟢 Value** (Market Pricing) — Transferable medium, proportional exchange
- **🟡 Immediate** (Communal Sharing) — Direct swaps, tit-for-tat, visceral fairness

## Core Insight

Competing "origin stories" of money aren't contradictory—they each reflect one fairness mode. Money reforms spark moral outrage because each mode plugs into deep fairness instincts. Understanding BOVI means seeing monetary policy as moral psychology, not just economics.

## Features

### 🎓 Interactive Learning Modules
- Individual deep-dives into each BOVI mode
- Historical examples and modern applications
- Interactive demos showing each fairness logic in action

### 🎭 Scenario-Based Learning
- Real-world situations analyzed through BOVI lens
- Multi-mode breakdowns showing how fairness modes interact
- Practical examples from rent negotiations to grocery shopping

### 📦 Bundle Explorer
- Understand how modes layer together in modern money systems
- Explore why unbundling is difficult but necessary
- Crypto's errors and opportunities through BOVI framework

### 🎨 Polished UX
- Clean, professional interface inspired by the LTS Money App
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Smooth interactions and micro-animations

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Explore the framework starting with the Overview section
4. Try the interactive demos and scenarios

## Educational Approach

### Learning Path
1. **Overview** — Understand the core BOVI insight
2. **Individual Modes** — Deep dive into each fairness logic
3. **Scenarios** — See BOVI in real-world situations
4. **Bundle Analysis** — Understand why reform is hard

### Key Pedagogical Principles
- **Scenarios First** — Start with concrete examples, not abstract theory
- **Interactive Discovery** — Learn through doing, not reading
- **Personal Relevance** — Connect to everyday money experiences
- **Progressive Complexity** — Build from simple to sophisticated understanding

## Target Audiences

- **Students** — Economics, psychology, anthropology courses
- **Professionals** — FinTech, policy makers, financial advisors
- **General Public** — Anyone wanting to understand money's moral dimensions
- **Researchers** — Exploring fairness, behavioral economics, monetary theory

## Theoretical Foundation

BOVI builds on Alan Fiske's Relational Models Theory, mapping his four fundamental patterns of social interaction to monetary exchange:

| Fiske Model | BOVI Mode | Fairness Logic | Example |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Equality Matching | Balanced | Symmetry, turn-taking | Tally sticks |
| Authority Ranking | Obligated | Hierarchical compliance | Tax payments |
| Market Pricing | Value | Proportional exchange | Currency trading |
| Communal Sharing | Immediate | Direct equivalence | Neighborhood favors |
