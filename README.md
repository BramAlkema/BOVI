## 🎯 What is BOVI?

BOVI explains that money isn't a single invention—it's a **bundle of four fairness modes** that humans use to structure exchange. Each mode maps to Alan Fiske's relational models and solves different trade problems:

### The Four Modes

| Mode | Symbol | Relational Model | Core Principle | Examples |
|------|--------|------------------|----------------|----------|
| **🔵 Balanced** | `B` | Equality Matching | Fairness as symmetry | Ledgers, tallies, turn-taking |
| **🔴 Obligated** | `O` | Authority Ranking | Fairness as compliance | Taxes, rent, hierarchical duties |
| **🟢 Value** | `V` | Market Pricing | Fairness as proportionality | Price discovery, transferable units |
| **🟡 Immediate** | `I` | Communal Sharing | Fairness as direct equivalence | Tit-for-tat, visceral fairness |

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Modular Design

The BOVI Framework is built as **37 focused modules** with clear separation of concerns:

```
lib/
├── core/           # Constants, bus, receipts, rulers
├── monitoring/     # KPI dashboard, performance tracking  
├── services/       # Business logic (rulers, contracts, storm-mode)
├── ui/            # Interactive components and dashboards
├── integration/   # System orchestration and initialization
└── plugins/       # Extensible plugin system
```

### Key Features

- **🎯 Real-time KPI Monitoring** - 16 metrics with red/amber/green thresholds
- **⚡ Performance Tracking** - Sub-200ms response times for core operations
- **🔧 Storm Mode** - Automated crisis response with preset changes
- **📋 Smart Contracts** - Index-linked agreements with automatic adjustments
- **👥 Cohort Engine** - Group formation with mathematical fairness guarantees
- **📊 Export System** - Complete data portability in JSON format

## 🛠️ Development

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/BramAlkema/BOVI.git
cd BOVI
npm install

# Start development
npm run dev              # Local server at http://localhost:8080
npm run dev:watch        # TypeScript compilation with watch
```

### Build Commands

```bash
npm run build           # Resilient production build
npm run validate        # Pre-deployment validation
npm run typecheck       # TypeScript compilation check
npm run lint            # Code quality checks
npm run test            # Run test suite
npm run rollback list   # Show deployment backups
```

### Resilient Deployment System

The project features a **deployment-resilient architecture** that survives major restructuring:

- **Auto-discovery build** - Adapts to file structure changes
- **Pre-deployment validation** - Catches issues before going live
- **Emergency rollback** - Quick recovery from failed deployments
- **Centralized configuration** - Easy maintenance and updates

## 📊 System Health

The KPI dashboard monitors:

### Performance Metrics
- **Ruler Switch Time**: <200ms (green), 200-1000ms (amber), >1000ms (red)
- **Money-veil Calculation**: <500ms target
- **API Response Time**: <500ms average
- **System Uptime**: >99% target

### User Engagement
- **Ruler Adoption Rate**: >60% try non-default rulers
- **Contract Completion Rate**: >90% signed
- **Cohort Satisfaction**: >95% no-one-worse-off guarantee

### System Quality  
- **Failed Payment Rate**: <0.5% 
- **Rule Compliance**: >90% using latest rules
- **Appeal Resolution**: <3 days average

## 🎓 Educational Applications

### Interactive Learning
- **Mode Deep-dives** - Hands-on exploration of each fairness mode
- **Real-world Scenarios** - Navigate grocery inflation, rent negotiation, energy switching
- **Bundle Understanding** - See how all four modes work together

### Target Audiences
- **📚 Students** - Economics, psychology, anthropology courses
- **💼 Professionals** - FinTech, policy makers, financial advisors  
- **🌍 General Public** - Understanding money's moral dimensions
- **👩‍💻 Developers** - Example of modular educational architecture

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### TypeScript-First
```typescript
// Centralized constants with type safety
import { BoviMode, BoviEvents } from './lib/core/constants.js';

// KPI tracking with automatic status determination
const metric = createKPIMetric("ruler_switch_time", 150, "stable");

// Event bus with compile-time safety
Bus.emit(BoviEvents.RULER_CHANGED, { ruler: "LTS", performance: 145 });
```

### Modular Plugin System
```typescript
// Extensible architecture
import { PluginManager } from './lib/plugins/plugin-manager.js';
import { KPIDashboard } from './lib/monitoring/kpi-dashboard.js';

const dashboard = new KPIDashboard();
PluginManager.register('monitoring', dashboard);
```

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading** - Components load on demand
- **Bundle Splitting** - Separate app.min.js and lib bundles
- **CSS Optimization** - Minified styles with auto-discovery
- **Asset Caching** - Efficient browser caching strategy
