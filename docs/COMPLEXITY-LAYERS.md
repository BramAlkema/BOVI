# BOVI Complexity Layers (M0-M4)

*Progressive disclosure of sophistication for different user experience levels*

## üéØ Design Philosophy

BOVI uses **progressive complexity layers** where abstractions work intuitively at the surface level, but users can drill down through increasing levels of sophistication. Each layer hides the complexity of deeper layers while remaining fully functional.

## üìö The Five Layers

### **M0: Intuitive Money App**
*"It just works"*

- **Target User**: General public, casual users
- **Experience**: Quirky money app with different UI "skins" (memeplexes)
- **Key Feature**: Plugin system that changes UI based on different mental models
- **Complexity**: Zero - everything automated and intuitive
- **Examples**: 
  - Satnav plugin with simple "Keep me safe" button
  - Different visual themes for different fairness intuitions
  - Basic mode switching without explanation needed

### **M1: Light Configuration**
*"I want some control"*

- **Target User**: Users who want to understand their options
- **Experience**: Safe defaults with ability to override
- **Key Feature**: Simple toggles and preferences
- **Complexity**: Minimal - clear on/off switches
- **Examples**:
  - Choose which automated decisions to apply
  - Basic notification preferences
  - Simple ruler switching

### **M2: Power User Tools**
*"I want to understand the system"*

- **Target User**: Financially engaged users, prosumers
- **Experience**: Sophisticated fairness tools and analysis
- **Key Feature**: Cohorts, personal data analysis, money-veil calculations
- **Complexity**: Moderate - requires economic intuition
- **Examples**:
  - Cohort formation and group switching
  - Personal inflation tracking vs official rates
  - Money-veil card showing purchasing power changes
  - PDA (Personal Data Assessment) tools

### **M3: Advanced Economic Modeling**
*"I want sophisticated control"*

- **Target User**: Financial professionals, policy wonks, economists
- **Experience**: Complex economic modeling and smart contracts
- **Key Feature**: Index commons, storm mode, programmable contracts
- **Complexity**: High - requires economic sophistication
- **Examples**:
  - Smart contracts with automatic index adjustments
  - Local knowledge capture in index commons
  - Storm mode for crisis response automation
  - Visual flow editor for creating custom workflows

### **M4: Expert/Developer Level**
*"I want full extensibility"*

- **Target User**: Developers, researchers, system designers
- **Experience**: Full customization and extensibility
- **Key Feature**: Butler hub, distribution systems, experimental trials
- **Complexity**: Expert - requires programming/system design knowledge
- **Examples**:
  - Custom plugin development
  - Experimental trial frameworks
  - Advanced distribution mechanisms
  - Full API access and customization

## üîÑ Progressive Disclosure Principles

### **Abstraction Without Loss**
- M0 users never see M3/M4 complexity
- But the full power remains accessible to those who need it
- No "dumbed down" versions - same underlying system

### **Intuitive Entry Points**
- Each layer should feel natural for its target sophistication level
- M0 should require zero learning curve
- Progressive revelation as users get curious

### **Memeplex Flexibility**
- Different UI plugins can present the same underlying system
- Tailored to different mental models and political/economic worldviews
- Same fairness modes, different cultural packaging

### **Expert Accessibility**
- Power users can bypass abstractions when needed
- Direct access to underlying mechanisms
- Extensibility for unforeseen use cases

## üéõÔ∏è Implementation Strategy

### **Layer Independence**
Each complexity layer should be independently functional:
- M0 users get complete experience without M1-M4
- M2 users don't need to understand M3-M4 
- M4 users can ignore M0-M3 abstractions if desired

### **Contextual Revelation**
Complexity should be revealed contextually:
- Show more sophisticated options when users demonstrate readiness
- Progressive onboarding based on usage patterns
- "Advanced" toggles that reveal deeper functionality

### **Plugin Architecture**
The UI plugin system enables:
- Different presentations of the same underlying system
- Memeplex-appropriate language and metaphors
- Cultural/political customization without system changes

*This layered approach ensures BOVI works for everyone from casual users to financial system designers, without compromising functionality at any level.*
