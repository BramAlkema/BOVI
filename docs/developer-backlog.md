# BOVI Developer Backlog

This document outlines the development roadmap for BOVI Framework, organized around two complementary philosophical approaches to economic system design.

## Overview

The backlog is structured around two stances that can coexist within the BOVI ecosystem:

- **Friedman Stance**: Rules, stability, competition through clear standards
- **Hayek Stance**: Pluralism, exit rights, local knowledge capture

Each feature includes API definitions, UI requirements, and key performance indicators (KPIs).
