# BOVI Developer Backlog

This document outlines the development roadmap for BOVI Framework, organized around two complementary philosophical approaches to economic system design.

## Overview

The backlog is structured around two stances that can coexist within the BOVI ecosystem:

- **Friedman Stance**: Rules, stability, competition through clear standards
- **Hayek Stance**: Pluralism, exit rights, local knowledge capture

Each feature includes API definitions, UI requirements, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

### Development Phases

**Phase 1 (Foundation)**
- Rules Registry
- Macro Anchoring  
- Basic Rails Marketplace
- Appeal Hooks

**Phase 2 (Competition)**
- Butler Competition
- Plural Indices Marketplace
- Rail Neutrality
- Local Knowledge Capture

**Phase 3 (Federation)**
- Indexation Pack
- Bracket Simulator
- Butler Hub SDK
- Federated Cohorts

### Quality Gates
- All APIs must have TypeScript definitions
- Unit tests with >80% coverage
- Integration tests for cross-component features
- Performance benchmarks for compute-heavy features
- Security audit for privacy-sensitive components

*This backlog balances the need for stable, predictable systems (Friedman) with the benefits of competition, choice, and local knowledge (Hayek). Features from both stances can be implemented in parallel, creating a robust ecosystem that serves diverse user needs while maintaining economic coherence.*
