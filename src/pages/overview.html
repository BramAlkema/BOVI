    <h2>The BOVI Framework</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">Money isn't a single invention—it's a bundle of four fairness modes that humans use to structure exchange. Each mode maps to Alan Fiske's relational models and solves different trade problems.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <span class="mode-badge balanced">B</span>
        <h4>Balanced (Equality Matching)</h4>
        <p class="text-small">Fairness as symmetry. Ledgers, tallies, keeping score across time. Everyone gets their turn, debts must be squared.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <span class="mode-badge obligated">O</span>
        <h4>Obligated (Authority Ranking)</h4>
        <p class="text-small">Fairness as compliance with hierarchy. You owe taxes, rent, tribute. Money as political infrastructure.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <span class="mode-badge value">V</span>
        <h4>Value (Market Pricing)</h4>
        <p class="text-small">Fairness as proportionality. Transferable medium where units are interchangeable. Minimal money.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <span class="mode-badge immediate">I</span>
        <h4>Immediate (Communal Sharing)</h4>
        <p class="text-small">Fairness as direct equivalence. Tit-for-tat swaps. Anchors our visceral fairness instinct.</p>

    <h3>Core Insight</h3>
    <p>Competing "origin stories" of money aren't contradictory—they each reflect one fairness mode. The BOVI bundle explains why money reforms spark moral outrage: each mode plugs into a deep fairness instinct.</p>
